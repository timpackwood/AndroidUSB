; Application Errors
; --------------------------------------------------------------------

AppError1:  BRA     AppError1
; This error occurs if the application enters the USB Interrupt 
; Service Routine but the USB1IF (USB interrupt flag) is not set.

AppError2:  BRA     AppError2
; This error occurs if the USB error interrupt flag has been raised
; but no USB error flags are set.

AppError3:  BRA     AppError3
; This error occurs if the application enters the USB Interrupt
; Service Routine, finds that the USB1IF flag is set, but that no
; USB interrupt flags in U1IR have been raised.

AppError4:  BRA     AppError4
; This error occurs if the application tries to load the address of
; of the BDT table and finds that the address is not aligned to a
; 512 byte boundary.

AppError5:  BRA     AppError5
; A transaction has been processed and the TRNIF interrupt has been
; raised but the CPU does not own the relevant buffer descriptor
; entry.

AppError6:  BRA     AppError6
; A control transfer is in progress but the status register is
; currupt. Application cannot determine whether control transfer is
; in setup, data or status stage.

AppError7:  BRA     AppError7
; No support for greater than 16 bit USB endpoint addresses.

AppError8:  BRA     AppError8
; Unexpected behaviour. Previous stage of control transfer failed
; to set up next stage correctly.

AppError9:  BRA     AppError9
; Attempt by application to access an unimplemented region of the
; USB Request Jump Table.

AppError10:  BRA     AppError10
; No support for data toggle synchronisation.

AppError11:  BRA     AppError11
; Too much data sent in the data stage of the control transfer

AppError12:  BRA     AppError12
; CT registry entry incorectly described current request as WRITE

AppError13:  BRA     AppError13
; USB protocol error: status stage of a read control transfer
; incorrectly reported a non-zero length data packet.

AppError14:  BRA     AppError14
; USB protocol error: status stage of a read control transfer
; incorrectly reported a DATA0 packet.

AppError15:  BRA     AppError15
; The application failed to return from processing a request.

; A windows command contained an undefined instruction

AppError18:  BRA     AppError18
; An interrupt transfer buffer overrun might take place on the next
; transfer

AppError19:  BRA     AppError19
; The interrupt transfer TX buffer has overflowed

AppError20:  BRA     AppError20

; loop hangs for any reason. Fatel exception.

AppError25:  BRA     AppError25

; the previous instance had exited. Condition arises if the pressure
