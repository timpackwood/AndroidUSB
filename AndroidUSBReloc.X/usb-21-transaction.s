* Title: USB Transaction Processing Routine
*
* Version: 2.1
*
* Purpose: The USB defines three types of USB transaction: IN; OUT;
*          and SETUP. IN refers to a transfer from the device to the
*          host. Each consists of three parts: a token packet; a data
*          packet; and a handshake packet. The reception and
*          transmission of these transactions is handled entirely
*          by the USB Module. In the case of a transmission, the CPU
*          chooses the token (IN) and loads data into the buffer. The
*          host then initiates the transaction whenever it likes, and
*          the success or failure is reported to the CPU using the
*          Transaction Complete Interrupt (TRNIF). In the case of a
*          reception, the Transaction Complete Interrupt informs the
*          CPU that the transaction has occured and the CPU reads the
*          token type (OUT or SETUP) from a register, and reads the
*          received data from the buffer.
*
*          The three types of USB transaction are the basis for the
*          more complicated transfer types: control; interrupt, bulk
*          and isochronous.
*
*          The routine in this file controls is exectuted whenever a
*          USB transaction has completed. It acts as an arbiter
*          for assigning the correct process to handle the
*          transaction, depending on what transfer type is currently
*          in progress. It also stores information about the
*          transaction in temporary registers that can be accessed
*          by various other processes.

; USB Transaction Processing Routine
; --------------------------------------------------------------------
; This routine is called every time the TRNIF interrupt is raised.
; The process determines the transfer type currently underway and
; hands the processing of the transaction to the relevent handling
; routine. If no transfer is is currently underway then the routine
; starts the appropriate transfer by calling the relavent transfer
; routine. The routine also processes errors which may be present in
; the transaction.
